# Intro & Install

## Introduction

A High-level Scorecard Modeling API

[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/scorecardbundle)](https://pepy.tech/project/scorecardbundle)  [![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scorecardbundle?color=orange)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scorecardbundle?color=orange)

Scorecard-Bundle is a **high-level Scorecard modeling API** that is easy-to-use and **Scikit-Learn consistent**.  It covers the major steps to train a Scorecard model such as feature discretization with ChiMerge, WOE encoding, feature evaluation with information value and collinearity, Logistic-Regression-based Scorecard model, and model evaluation for binary classification tasks. All the transformer and model classes in Scorecard-Bundle comply with Scikit-Learn‘s fit-transform-predict convention.

## Installment

Note that Scorecard-Bundle depends on NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and SciPy, which can be installed individually or together through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

- Pip: Scorecard-Bundle can be installed with pip:  `pip install --upgrade scorecardbundle` 

- Manually: Download codes from github `<https://github.com/Lantianzz/Scorecard-Bundle>` and import them directly:

  ```python
  import sys
  sys.path.append('E:\Github\Scorecard-Bundle') # add path that contains the codes
  from scorecardbundle.feature_discretization import ChiMerge as cm
  from scorecardbundle.feature_discretization import FeatureIntervalAdjustment as fia
  from scorecardbundle.feature_encoding import WOE as woe
  from scorecardbundle.feature_selection import FeatureSelection as fs
  from scorecardbundle.model_training import LogisticRegressionScoreCard as lrsc
  from scorecardbundle.model_evaluation import ModelEvaluation as me
  ```
