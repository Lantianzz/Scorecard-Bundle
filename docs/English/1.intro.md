# Intro & Install

## Introduction

A High-level Scorecard Modeling API

[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/scorecardbundle)](https://pepy.tech/project/scorecardbundle)  [![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scorecardbundle?color=orange)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scorecardbundle?color=orange)

Scorecard-Bundle is a **high-level Scorecard modeling API** that is easy-to-use and **Scikit-Learn consistent**.  It covers the major steps to train a Scorecard model such as feature discretization with ChiMerge, WOE encoding, feature evaluation with information value and collinearity, Logistic-Regression-based Scorecard model, model evaluation for binary classification tasks, and model interpretation tools for Scorecard. All the transformer and model classes in Scorecard-Bundle comply with Scikit-Learn‘s fit-transform-predict convention.

A complete example showing how to build a scorecard with Scorecard-Bundle: [Example Notebooks](https://scorecard-bundle.bubu.blue/Notebooks/);

Detailed documentation about the package: [API Reference](https://scorecard-bundle.bubu.blue/API/);

In Scorecard-Bundle, core codes such as WOE/IV calculation and scorecard transformation were written based on Mamdouh Refaat's book '"Credit Risk Scorecards: Development and Implementation Using SAS"；ChiMerge was written based on Randy Kerber's paper "ChiMerge: Discretization of Numeric Attributes".

## Installation

**Installing the latest version [![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scorecardbundle?color=orange)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scorecardbundle?color=orange)  is strongly recommended** as every version either corrected known bugs or added useful functionality.  In principle, critical bugs are fixed as soon as they are revealed. Therefore please file an issue on [Github](https://github.com/Lantianzz/Scorecard-Bundle) if you suspect the presence of a bug when using Scorecard-Bundle.

Note that Scorecard-Bundle depends on NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and SciPy, which can be installed individually or together through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

- Pip: Scorecard-Bundle can be installed with pip:  `pip install --upgrade scorecardbundle` 
  
  ！**Note that the latest version may be not available at some pip mirror site** (e.g. *https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/*). Therefore in order to update to the latest version,  use the following command to specify the source as *https://pypi.org/project*
  
  ~~~bash
  pip install -i https://pypi.org/project --upgrade scorecardbundle
  ~~~
  
  Import packages: 
  
  ```python
  from scorecardbundle.feature_discretization import ChiMerge as cm
  from scorecardbundle.feature_discretization import FeatureIntervalAdjustment as fia
  from scorecardbundle.feature_encoding import WOE as woe
  from scorecardbundle.feature_selection import FeatureSelection as fs
  from scorecardbundle.model_training import LogisticRegressionScoreCard as lrsc
  from scorecardbundle.model_evaluation import ModelEvaluation as me
  from scorecardbundle.model_interpretation import ScorecardExplainer as mise
  ```


- Manually: Download codes from github `<https://github.com/Lantianzz/Scorecard-Bundle>` and import them directly:

  ```python
  import sys
  sys.path.append('E:\Github\Scorecard-Bundle') # add path that contains the codes
  from scorecardbundle.feature_discretization import ChiMerge as cm
  from scorecardbundle.feature_discretization import FeatureIntervalAdjustment as fia
  from scorecardbundle.feature_encoding import WOE as woe
  from scorecardbundle.feature_selection import FeatureSelection as fs
  from scorecardbundle.model_training import LogisticRegressionScoreCard as lrsc
  from scorecardbundle.model_evaluation import ModelEvaluation as me
  from scorecardbundle.model_interpretation import ScorecardExplainer as mise
  ```
